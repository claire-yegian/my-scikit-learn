# My SciKit Learn

The mysklearn folder contains a simplified implementation a few main classifiers and other functions of SciKit Learn's more complex machine learning library. I have implemented the following classifiers: simple linear regression, k nearest neighbors, dummy, naive bayes, decision tree, and random forrest. The folder also includes functions to perform data splitting tasks, like a stratefied k fold split and an implementation of the bootstrap method. It has methods for confusion matrix construction and other perfomance measures like precision, recall, and F1 scores. Finally, mysklearn contains helper funtions to build charts and plots for data representation.

After constructing my own mini sci-kit learn, I was able to use the package for a team data science project on Spotify music popularity trends. Using the Kaggle dataset I worked with a partner, Anna Cardinal, to clean and then evaluate the data. Our data cleaning process is described and executed in data_clean.ipynb, and our results can be found in technical_report.ipynb.

# Spotify Popularity Trends
### Anna Cardinal and Claire Yegian

# How To Run:
* First Run the data_clean.ipynb to prepare the dataset for usage
* Then run technical_report.ipynb to get data analysis and classification results
* This is also the order our technical report is in

# How To Read:
* See project_proposal.ipynb for dataset background
* Read data_clean.ipynb and the technical_report.ipynb to see full technical report
